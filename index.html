              Yes Day was the ninth most-watched movie on Netflix in 2021,
              attracting millions of viewers from around the world. The
              feel-good family flick stars Jennifer Garner, Edgar Ramírez, and
              Jenna Ortega. Allison (Garner) and Carlos Torres (Ramírez) used
              to know how to have fun, but after three kids and a mountain of
              responsibility later, things have changed. Now they spend most
              of their time saying 'no' to fun, that is until their eldest
              daughter challenges them to a Yes Day, where they agree to every
              one of their children's wild requests for 24 hours. It is a
              super fun, very sweet film that every parent will be able to
              relate to and every child will want to reenact.
